# Modeling the Marked Self-Exciting Process
***
In this paper, we study the self-exciting process with focus on microeconometrics setting. The following is the structure of this paper.

## Introduction
 * Emphasize the dynamic structure using a simple on-line shopping example.

 * Existing econometrics literature fail to handle the problem.

  * Time series -> require data to be aggregated
  * Autoregreesion conditional duration model -> difficult to incorporate covariates


 * Introducing  intensity based self-exciting model
  * Using Hawkes process as example

* The improvement in this paper -> Including the marks

  * The importance of marks. (Using the previous on-line shopping example)
  * Existing econometrics literature did not cover this topic
  * Other fields like seismology study indeed introduce the marks (review literature), but the settings may not suitable for econometrics study.



* Promote the use of history information as a proxy of heterogeneity.


* Mention the Stute's method and compare it with likelihood based method.


* Organization of this paper

## Basic Concepts
* Reviewing (marked) point process

* Main topic: Intensity

  * With the relation of the compensator
  * Filtration with emphasizing on self-exciting
    * Stopping times
    * Predictability


* Doob-Meyer

* Compare intensity with density -> likelihood

## Mark Space
* The generic separation of ground intensity and the conditional mark density

* Discrete mark space

  * discrete choice question
  * special discrete mark space {0,1} -> censoring




## Estimation Method and Simulation
* The Stute's martingale based estimation method.
  * compare with likelihood based method,highlight the dominate problem.


* Estimating the conditional mark space -> recommend use nonparametric method

* Simulation

## Numerical Application
* Motivation and literature review

* The intensity model

* Introducing the data

* Present and discuss the results

* Absent of testing method

## Conclusion
